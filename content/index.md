title: Not Every Seed Sprouts
---

Welcome! This is a small, blog-like static site where I share ideas and insights as they come to me. I like to think of these posts as "seeds," inspired by the concept of [**digital gardening**](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought).

I've started countless side projects—some led to valuable lessons, others were just a lot of fun. Basically none of them have been completed. That’s why I'm starting to look at my **seeds** as something which may never sprout, and that’s perfectly fine. A garden tended only for profit turns into a soulless greenhouse.
