I recently realized that, despite the vast landscape of game development tools, there aren’t that many UI libraries available. Sure, we have some options, but it makes me wonder—would it be worth starting a side project to "reinvent the wheel" once again?

Some related thoughts:

- The days of Scaleform are long gone (let’s take a moment to remember Flash and its SWF format).
- Immediate mode UI is becoming the go-to approach for debugging and tooling. Dear ImGui, in particular, seems to be integrated into every game I’ve seen in recent years.
- When it comes to mature middleware, I can only think of **Gameface** and **Noesis GUI**. There are likely others, but they’re still in the early stages—especially in terms of adoption by major games.
- These middleware solutions aren’t free. Their pricing is probably reasonable, but I wonder if there’s room for something more affordable—perhaps targeting just PC and mobile instead of a full cross-platform suite.
- The built-in UI solutions from major third-party engines leave a lot to be desired. Too many limitations, too many workarounds (_yes, Unity, I’m looking at you_).
- Open-source options are rare. **RmlUI** is one of the few worth mentioning, and it deserves some praise.

With all that in mind, I can’t help but wonder—should I start a small open-source project to build a bare-bones UI library with a clear vision? It might just be another seed lost in my garden, but who knows?
